                    Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child
                    and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable
                    diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.
            
                    Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities
                    to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.
